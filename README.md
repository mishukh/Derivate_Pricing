# Derivatives Pricing with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to perform derivative pricing, specifically using supervised regression models to learn the Black-Scholes option pricing formula from simulated data. The Black-Scholes model is a widely used mathematical framework for pricing European options.

---

## Black-Scholes Formula
The Black-Scholes formula used in this project is as follows:

```math
C = S_0 e^{-qT} N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
```

where:

- **S**: Stock Price  
- **K**: Strike Price  
- **r**: Risk-free rate  
- **q**: Annual dividend yield (set to 0 in this project)  
- **T-t**: Time to maturity  
- **Ïƒ (sigma)**: Volatility  
- **M (Moneyness)**: Defined as \( M = \frac{K}{S} \)

---

## Key Features
### Simulated Data Generation
- Moneyness, time to maturity, and volatility are simulated using predefined functions.
- The Black-Scholes formula is applied to calculate option prices.

### Machine Learning Models
- Various regression models are implemented, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks
- Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most impactful features.

### Libraries Used
- **Data Manipulation**: `numpy`, `pandas`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `keras`
- **Statistical Analysis**: `statsmodels`
- **Time Series Modeling**: `ARIMA`

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras statsmodels
```

---

## Code Structure
### True Parameters
The following parameters are defined:

```python
true_alpha = 0.1
true_beta = 0.1
true_sigma0 = 0.2
risk_free_rate = 0.05
```

### Functions for Option Pricing and Volatility
Two main functions:
1. `option_vol_from_surface(moneyness, time_to_maturity)`: Calculates volatility based on moneyness and time to maturity.
2. `call_option_price(moneyness, time_to_maturity, option_vol)`: Computes the call option price using the Black-Scholes formula.

---

## Data Simulation
Simulated data includes:
- **Moneyness** \( \frac{K}{S} \)
- **Time to maturity** \( T - t \)
- **Volatility** \( \sigma \)
- **Option prices**

### Dataset Example
| Price | Moneyness | Time | Volatility |
|-------|----------|------|------------|
| 0.150 | 0.924    | 0.343 | 0.234      |
| 0.114 | 1.089    | 0.502 | 0.251      |

### Summary Statistics
| Feature   | Mean  | Std Dev | Min  | Max  |
|-----------|-------|---------|------|------|
| Price     | 0.179 | 0.136   | 0.000 | 0.885 |
| Moneyness | 0.997 | 0.251   | 0.117 | 1.918 |
| Time      | 0.498 | 0.286   | 0.000 | 1.000 |
| Volatility | 0.256 | 0.030  | 0.200 | 0.363 |

---

## Results and Insights
- Feature importance scores from regression models indicate that:
  - **Moneyness** is the most impactful feature.
  - **Volatility** and **Time to maturity** also contribute significantly.
